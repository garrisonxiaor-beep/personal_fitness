# User Data Management

Use this reference when the user asks to save, import, update, persist, review, or reuse long-term fitness data such as profile, training history, body metrics, or nutrition logs.

## Purpose

Maintain a portable user data store that works across Agent Skills-compatible runtimes without requiring a database.

## Data store layout

Use a folder outside the skill package for real user data, for example `user-data/` in the current project or another user-approved location.

```text
user-data/
  profile.json
  training-history.json
  body-metrics-history.json
  nutrition-history.json
```

Do not store private user data inside the reusable skill folder unless the user explicitly asks for a local demo fixture.

## Script support

Use `scripts/manage_user_data.py` when the runtime can execute Python:

```bash
python scripts/manage_user_data.py init user-data
python scripts/manage_user_data.py import-training user-data workout-log.csv
python scripts/manage_user_data.py import-body user-data body-metrics.csv
python scripts/manage_user_data.py import-nutrition user-data nutrition-log.csv
python scripts/manage_user_data.py summary user-data
```

The script uses only the Python standard library and deduplicates repeated imports with stable entry IDs.

If Python execution is unavailable, create or update the JSON files manually using the templates in `templates/user-data/`.

## Data types

| File | Purpose | Main consumers |
|---|---|---|
| `profile.json` | Goal, schedule, training age, equipment, constraints, preferences | `user-profile-intake.md`, all goal modules |
| `training-history.json` | Completed workouts and imported logs | `training-log-analysis.md`, `summarize_training_logs.py` |
| `body-metrics-history.json` | Weight, waist, measurements, photos, steps, sleep, cardio | `body-metrics-analysis.md` |
| `nutrition-history.json` | Meals, calories, macros, hunger, adherence notes | `nutrition-log-analysis.md`, fat-loss module |

## Update rules

- Ask before creating or modifying a long-term user data folder.
- Preserve raw imported fields under `raw` when possible.
- Keep imported records append-only unless the user asks to correct or delete an entry.
- Mark uncertain screenshot extraction with `confidence: "screenshot_uncertain"`.
- Never expose API keys or private secrets in saved JSON.
- When data conflicts, keep both records and note the conflict instead of silently overwriting.

## Analysis order

1. Read `profile.json` for goal, constraints, schedule, and equipment.
2. Read recent `training-history.json` entries for completed work.
3. Read `body-metrics-history.json` when body composition matters.
4. Read `nutrition-history.json` when the user asks about diet, cut, bulk, recomposition, adherence, or recovery.
5. Route to the goal module and recommendation decision tree.

## Output requirements

When updating saved data, say:

- Which store path was used.
- Which files were created or updated.
- How many records were imported and how many were skipped as duplicates.
- What analysis should run next.
